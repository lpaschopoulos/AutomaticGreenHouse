Using the following libraries:

1. Wire.h: This library allows communication with I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) devices, such as LiquidCrystal_I2C display.

The Wire.h library is included in the standard Arduino libraries, so you do not need to download it separately. It should 
already be available in your Arduino IDE when you install the Arduino software.

2. LiquidCrystal_I2C.h: This library is used to control LCD displays that communicate via the I2C protocol.

3. OneWire.h: This library is used for interfacing with One-Wire devices, such as the temperature sensors.

4. DallasTemperature.h: This library is used in conjunction with the OneWire library to interface with Dallas Semiconductor/Maxim temperature sensors.

5. DHT.h: This library is used for reading data from DHT series humidity and temperature sensors.

6. AccelStepper.h: This library is used for controlling stepper motors with acceleration capabilities.
